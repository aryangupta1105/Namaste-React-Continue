//  const styleCard = {
//   backgroundColor: '#f0f0f0',
// };

// * Props :

// * prop -> is Just a JS Object

// * Note: When you have to dainamically pass in a data to a component, you pass in prop

// const RestaurantCard = (props) => {
// console.log(props);

// * Note We can also destructure props on the fly by wrapping them in between {}, this is like...

// * const { resName, cuisine } = props;

// const RestaurantCard = ({ resName, cuisine }) => {
//   console.log({ resName, cuisine });



// * not using keys (not acceptable) <<<< index as a key <<<<<<<<<< unique id (is the best  practice)



// * What is Config-driven-UI -> A "config-driven UI" is a user interface that is built and configured using a declarative configuration file or data structure, rather than being hardcoded.

// * Every company now-a-days follows these approach, because our Appications need to be Dynamic These Days

// * Note: A Good Senior Frontend engineer is - who is a good UI Layer Engineer and a good Data Layer Engineer
